# Min's Simple Chat Application (Desktop)
_Copyright Â© 2022 Min Kabar Kyaw_

## Introduction
A simple chat program to pass messages asynchronously via the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Both hosts will run this program and connect to the other via their IP or hostname.

## The need for Asynchronous Programming
There are two main **I/O Bound** tasks in the program that will **block the program thread**:
- **Requesting a message from the remote host**
- **Getting user input to encapsulate and send to the remote host**

If both of these operations are run in the same thread, we will not be able to send a message until we receive a message, or vice versa. 

This application uses Java's **CompletableFuture** library to branch off a thread from the common thread pool to send messages, and uses the **Service** class of JavaFX's concurrency library to make a NetworkService that listens for incoming messages.

## System Overview
The application uses the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** framework.
- **Model:** Contains data that acts as a single source of truth, which is used by different components in the system (e.g. the target IP to connect to, JavaFX stage/window which is shared by different Views, etc).
- **View:** Consists of .fxml files in the resources folder, which specifies the layout of the different components in the JavaFX GUI interface.
- **Controller:** Handle various UI logic for each View and allow for switching of scenes depending on the user action/program states.
